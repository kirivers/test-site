            I recently graduated with my Masters from Columbia University, where I specialized in Data Science and Machine Learning. I grew up on the north shore of Massachusetts, and I love the outdoors, art, and my computers.

              I worked briefly as a Junior Software Engineer at DEKA Research and Development. There I constructed the frontend for several medical devices in use by thousands of patients. I ensured that both the patients, and the device engineers at DEKA could monitor performance, as any malfunction could have been life-threatening.

              I often code in Python, and I also use R, SQL, Java, Javascript, and Typescript. At Columbia, I took courses like Machine Learning, Applied Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision; now I can pick the right model for the job, build it from scratch or with libraries, tune it to perfection, and solve any problem you can throw at me.

              I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Middlebury College, so my coding background is robust. I also majored in English at Middlebury, which improves the clarity of my documentation and to become an adept technical communicator. Consequently, I taught numerous Middlebury faculty how to use platforms like Zoom, Panopto, and Canvas during the COVID transition online.

              I like to say that my biggest strength is my humility (oxymoron, I know). The more knowledge and skills I accrue, the more I learn just how little I know. I am always seeking to improve my methods and my results, and I never believe that I already have all of the answers.
